Get ready for the grand finale of my postgrad studies in **Frontend Development with React at Kożmiński University**: 
#### a Single Page Application that'll blow your socks off!

Here's what I've whipped up: You can book a room, add treatments to your cart, and check out your order summary all in one place. And, of course, I've got your back with a secure user account and authentication.

Here are the tech goodies I've used to bring this to life: **HTML, Sass, JavaScript, Parcel JS, and Litepicker**. Oh yeah!

But wait, there's more! Here's what's on my to-do list, because I never stop improving: switch over to an external database, use sessions for authentication, increase password security with some hashing magic, and add input validation. Watch this space!

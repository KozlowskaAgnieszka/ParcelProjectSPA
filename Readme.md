The final project of my postgrad studies in 
# Frontend Development with React at Kożmiński University: 
### a Single Page Application for SPA!

You can book a room, add treatments to your cart, and check out your order summary all in one place. And, of course, I've got your back with a user account and authentication.

The tech stach used: **HTML, Sass, JavaScript, Parcel JS, and Litepicker**.
